# Google Authentication 2.0
This project was created so I can familiarize myself with how Google Authentication is added to full-stack web applications. I also wanted to sharpen my MVC/Back-end abilities.
## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars, Materialize

this was my first time using Handlebars js which seems easier the EJS. I am used to creating different routes as well as using GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE functions. However, I would like to get more comfortable using these functions without having to search something etc... As a result, I made this for the extra repitition so I could engrave it into my BRAIN!

## Optimizations


This code was pretty straightforward. My biggest obstactle was changing "Url" to "URL" but that's the life of a software engineer! I am going to keep adding different functionalities such as Top 100 Cryptocurrencies API and this will be the base of my 100 Hours project!
