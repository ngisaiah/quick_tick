# QuickTick
A full-stack application used for tracking cryptocurrencies! User are able to sign in with Google and add their favorite coins to their favorites. There is also a "Notes" section used for storing any useful information. 
## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Handlebars, Materialize

This application was tricky to develop because of the ID variables being stored in the MonogoDB Atlas. I spent a lot of time getting the notes to save themselves within the data-id attribute so I can use it to send delete requests. 

## Optimizations


Right now I have completed the Authentication as well as the note taking functionality! Next I am going to research the CoinMarketCap API in order to pull realtime data that I can insert into a table. Lastly, I will add the "favorites" functionality where uses can store their top coins in order to make them easier to keep track of!
